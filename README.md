# ThreatEvolve E2 Review Tasks
This repository contains the tasks and resources for the ThreatEvolve E2 review process. The task is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of ThreatEvolve's in discovering novel APT variants.


## Experiment
The experiment involves running ThreatEvolve against a curated dataset of APT variants to assess its detection capabilities. The dataset includes both known and novel APT samples (C1-C6) to ensure a comprehensive evaluation.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple APT variants, each with a ground truth sequence of techniques. A sequence looks like this:

```T1566.001 -> T1078 -> T1105 -> T1021.002[tool:S0029] -> {T1018, T1083, T1082} -> T1003.001```
Each technique is represented by its MITRE ATT&CK ID.
Techniques are separated by "->" to indicate the order of execution.
Techniques in `{}` are meant to be alternative paths or techniques that can be executed in parallel.
Techniques with `[tool:XXXX]` or `[malware:XXXX]` indicate the specific tool or malware used to execute that technique.

## Your Task
As a reviewer, your task is to:
1. Analyze the provided dataset of APT variants.
2. Compare the candidates generated by ThreatEvolve (C1-C6) against the known APT samples (Ground Truth):
    2.1: Logical Coherence [1-10] score: Evaluate how logically coherent each candidate is, this means a sequence follows a logical progression without contradictions. 10 indicates perfect logical coherence, while 1 indicates significant logical flaws (*e.g. initial access appearing at the end of the sequence*).

    2.2: Operational Realism [1-10] score: Assess how realistic and feasible each candidate is in a real-world operational context. A score of 10 indicates that the sequence is highly plausible and aligns well with known APT behaviors, while a score of 1 suggests that the sequence is unrealistic or implausible (*e.g. contains techniques that are out of context, objectives that are not achievable...*).

    2.3: Same Objective [Yes/No]: Determine whether the candidate APT variant shares the same primary objective as the ground truth APT sample. This involves assessing whether the end goals of both sequences align, such as data exfiltration, disruption, or espionage. 'Yes' indicates that both sequences aim to achieve the same objective, while 'No' indicates differing objectives (*e.g. original APT's goal is to exfiltrate data, while the candidate's goal is to disrupt services*).

3. Provide feedback on each sequence if necessary, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.

## Submission
Please submit your evaluations in the provided template file `TE-E2-RESULTS-VALIDATION.xlsx`. Ensure that all fields are completed accurately. Some APTs may not have 6 candidates; in such cases, leave the corresponding fields blank.
